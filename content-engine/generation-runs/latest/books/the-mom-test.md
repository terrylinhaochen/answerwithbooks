# Regenerate Book Distillation

Return only the final Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Preserve the slug and core metadata unless the current copy is clearly weaker.
Use paraphrase by default. Do not invent quotations.

## Content Spec

# Answer with Books Content Generation Spec

This is the canonical shape for generated public content. The goal is not a book summary
library. The goal is a shelf of human-authored books converted into useful judgment for
specific situations.

## Shared Standards

- Write for a smart, busy reader with a real problem, not for someone browsing summaries.
- Use paragraphs as the default. Lists are allowed only for checklists, scripts, or compact
  decision rules.
- Keep every claim tied to one of three inputs: CrowdListen demand, source-book ideas, or
  visible user behavior.
- Do not fabricate quotations. Use short verified excerpts only when the source text has been
  reviewed; otherwise paraphrase and label the idea.
- Do not reproduce chapters, long passages, or comprehensive substitutes for a book.
- End with a practical action a reader or agent can use immediately.

## Book Distillation Shape

Each book page should answer: when should this book be called, what does it help you see, and
what reusable lenses does it add to the shelf?

Frontmatter:

- `title`
- `author`
- `year`
- `oneLiner`: one sentence describing what the book helps the reader understand or do.
- `readIf`: one concrete situation where the book is worth reaching for.
- `tags`
- `featured`
- `order`

Body:

1. Opening hook: 1-2 paragraphs on why the book earns a slot in the shelf.
2. `## What the book is about`: 2 paragraphs, not a chapter-by-chapter summary.
3. `## Core lessons`: 3-5 named lessons, each with a paragraph explaining how to use it.
4. `## How to use it`: practical lenses, scripts, checks, or decision rules.
5. `## When this lens breaks`: limits, common misuses, or cases where the book is insufficient.
6. `## Best paired with`: adjacent books or answer situations when available.

Avoid standalone `How I’ve applied it` sections. Application belongs inside the practical
lenses and answer pages.

## Answer Shape

Each answer page should answer: what is the reader really trying to solve, which books clarify
the situation, and what should happen next?

Frontmatter:

- `question`
- `description`: the decision rule preview shown in cards and SEO snippets.
- `books`
- `date`
- `featured`
- `tags`

Body:

1. Opening demand frame: 2-3 paragraphs describing the recurring question or situation.
2. `## What is really going on`: diagnosis, not generic advice.
3. `## What the books add`: the specific source-book lenses and why they matter here.
4. `## The working move`: the main action, script, checklist, or operating rule.
5. `## What to watch for`: failure modes, false positives, or cases where the advice breaks.
6. `## Try this next`: one concrete next step the reader or an agent can execute.

## Background Engine Record

For high-priority answers, add a `content-engine/content-packets/*.json` packet with:

- demand signal
- published output path
- source books and roles
- triage schema: `who`, `what`, `why`, `what_changed`, `what_should_happen_next`
- agent use cases

The public Markdown is the reader artifact. The packet is the machine-usable system-of-record
artifact.

## Current Markdown Body

## Core lessons

**1. Everyone lies to you, politely.**
People you interview want the conversation to go well. Your mom says your app idea is great because she loves you; strangers say it's great because it ends the meeting faster. The lie isn't malicious — it's social lubricant. The burden is on you to ask questions that even a polite person can't answer with a comfortable falsehood. The Mom Test is named for the standard it sets: your questions should be so grounded in facts that *even your mom* couldn't mislead you with them.

**2. Talk about their life, not your idea.**
The moment you pitch, the data is contaminated. Every question afterward measures how nice the person is, not how real the problem is. The fix is structural: ask about what they did last week, what it cost them, what they tried, who else they complained to. Their past behavior is evidence; their opinion of your future product is not.

**3. Compliments are worthless; commitments are gold.**
"That's really cool" is a deflection, not a data point. What counts is anything that costs the person something: time (a scheduled follow-up with a clear agenda), reputation (an intro to their boss or budget owner), or money (a pre-order, a letter of intent, a deposit). Fitzpatrick calls these *currency*. If a meeting ends with kind words and nothing on the calendar, it didn't go well — it went nowhere.

**4. Bad news is good news.**
A lukewarm "meh" that arrives in week two saves you the year you would have spent discovering it in production. The goal of customer conversations is truth, not validation. Learning that a problem doesn't matter, or that the customer has no budget, or that they've tried nothing to solve it (a tell that they don't really care) is a *successful* outcome.

**5. Some problems don't matter.**
People will cheerfully confirm that something is annoying. The real questions are: Where does this rank against everything else on their plate? What does it cost them? What have they already tried? If they've never Googled for a solution, the problem isn't burning enough to build a business on.

## Key frameworks

**The three rules of the Mom Test:**
1. Talk about their life instead of your idea.
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.
3. Talk less and listen more.

**Question quality check.** Bad: "Would you buy a product that did X?" (invites a hypothetical lie). Good: "What are you using now? What does it cost you? When did this last happen — walk me through it." Future tense and hypotheticals are where lies live; past tense and specifics are where truth lives.

**Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, dig beneath signals.** When you get a compliment, ignore it and move on. When you get a generic claim ("I always…", "I'd definitely…"), anchor it: "When did that last happen?" When you get an emotional signal (frustration, excitement), dig: "Tell me more about that."

**Commitment and advancement.** Every meeting should end by pushing for a next step that costs the prospect something. If you don't know what to ask for, you went into the meeting without a goal — Fitzpatrick's "three big questions" prep: decide in advance the three things you most need to learn.

**Keep it casual.** Early-stage learning conversations don't need a scheduled "interview." A good conversation about someone's workflow can happen at a conference, in a coffee line, or in a user's existing support thread. Formality raises the stakes and invites performance.

## When to reach for this book

- Before writing code for any new product or feature.
- When your user interviews keep producing enthusiastic feedback but no usage.
- When someone on the team says "everyone we talked to loved it" — this book is the antidote.
- When deciding whether a feature request is real or polite noise.

## Memorable ideas and lines

> "You shouldn't ask anyone whether your business is a good idea... It's a bad question and everyone will lie to you at least a little."

> "Opinions are worthless... Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie."

> "If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours."

The book's sharpest reframe: a failed conversation is one where you only collected compliments. By that standard, most "great meetings" founders report are failures.
